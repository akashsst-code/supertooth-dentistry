/**
 * Practice content, centralized. Per docs/supertooth-build-principles.md
 * Section 2 ("Content is separable from presentation"), this is the one
 * place site copy/data lives — components read from here, not hardcoded
 * strings scattered through JSX. When a CMS decision gets made (see the
 * open follow-up in docs/supertooth-platform-pivot.md), this file is what
 * gets replaced by CMS fetches, without touching component code.
 *
 * `real: true` fields are sourced from the locked docs (practice name,
 * "Queen Anne" location, Dr. Archana, service differentiators). Everything
 * else is `real: false` and MUST render through <Placeholder> until Akash
 * supplies the real value — see the content checklist in
 * docs/supertooth-priority-dimensions.md ("Website Build — Content Needed").
